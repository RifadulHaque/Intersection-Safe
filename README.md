# Intersection-Safe
• Designed a Hardware system to track the speed of vehicles at an intersection and take the following reading and 
store it cloud. If the speed of the vehicle is above 50Km/h at the intersection, then alert the cars at the other side 
using an alert module which is a flashing yellow light with a sign on it.
• Designed the software for it using python and used the OpenCV module for detecting vehicles and detecting their 
speed over a certain range of areas.
• Used ArduCam as the detection module for detecting the specific type of vehicles(cars).
• Created an Android App using Android Studio for observing all the reading and alerts for over speeding vehicle.
• Counted the total number of cars for getting statistical values for optimizing the traffic at certain areas.
